# SmartFarmFaceRecognitionSecuritySystem
The Smart Farm Face Recognition Security System is designed to enhance the security of farms  using Raspberry Pi 3B and a Pi Camera. The system automatically monitors the area, detects  motion using a PIR sensor, and captures images for face recognition. It identifies whether the  detected person is authorized or unknown.
